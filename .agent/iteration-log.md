# RocoDex Iteration Log

## 2026-06-26 — Stage 1 / 6 — IMPROVE

### Scope

- Built a no-login local collection workflow for saved creatures.
- Connected the collection workflow to comparison through validated query IDs.
- Fixed runtime instability found during browser verification: theme hydration mismatch and missing-auth session errors.

### Changed surfaces

- `/collection`
- `/compare?ids=...`
- Creature cards
- Creature detail pages
- Site header navigation
- `/login` and `/register` when auth secrets are absent

### Verification evidence

- Focused TDD run failed before implementation because collection/theme/auth helper modules and `parseComparisonIds` did not exist.
- Focused TDD run passed after implementation.
- `npm run lint` exited `0`.
- `npm test` passed 17 files / 73 tests.
- `npm run build` exited `0` and generated 735 static pages.
- Browser verification covered save/remove controls, collection count, collection-to-compare handoff, 390px mobile overflow, auth-unavailable fallback, and console error checks.

### Follow-up candidates

- Add richer collection grouping or notes once account sync requirements are explicit.
- Consider a compact mobile navigation treatment in the UI/UX stage.
