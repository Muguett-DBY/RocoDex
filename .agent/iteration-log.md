# RocoDex Iteration Log

## 2026-06-26 — Stage 1 / 6 — IMPROVE

### Scope

- Built a no-login local collection workflow for saved creatures.
- Connected the collection workflow to comparison through validated query IDs.
- Fixed runtime instability found during browser verification: theme hydration mismatch and missing-auth session errors.

### Changed surfaces

- `/collection`
- `/compare?ids=...`
- Creature cards
- Creature detail pages
- Site header navigation
- `/login` and `/register` when auth secrets are absent

### Verification evidence

- Focused TDD run failed before implementation because collection/theme/auth helper modules and `parseComparisonIds` did not exist.
- Focused TDD run passed after implementation.
- `npm run lint` exited `0`.
- `npm test` passed 17 files / 73 tests.
- `npm run build` exited `0` and generated 735 static pages.
- Browser verification covered save/remove controls, collection count, collection-to-compare handoff, 390px mobile overflow, auth-unavailable fallback, and console error checks.
- Commit `8e87ee8` was pushed to `origin/main`.
- GitHub remote check found no Actions run for `8e87ee8`; root `.github/workflows` is absent, and commit check-runs/statuses were both `0`.

### Follow-up candidates

- Add richer collection grouping or notes once account sync requirements are explicit.
- Consider a compact mobile navigation treatment in the UI/UX stage.

## 2026-06-26 — Stage 2 / 6 — IMPROVE

### Scope

- Added collection insights so saved creatures show guide coverage, PVP rating coverage, role coverage, attribute coverage, and next actions.
- Kept the implementation local/static; no auth, database, or network dependency was introduced.

### Changed surfaces

- `/collection`
- README collection documentation

### Verification evidence

- Focused TDD run failed before implementation because `src/lib/collection-insights.ts` did not exist.
- Focused TDD run passed after implementation.
- `npm run lint` exited `0`.
- `npm test` passed 18 files / 74 tests.
- `npm run build` exited `0` and generated 735 static pages.
- Browser verification covered `/collection` with two saved creatures, confirmed the insight panel, next-action text, no horizontal overflow, and console errors `0`.
- Commit `909d65b` was pushed to `origin/main`.
- GitHub remote check found no Actions run for `909d65b`; Vercel commit status completed successfully.

## 2026-06-26 — Stage 3 / 6 — UIUX

### Scope

- Reworked the site header for mobile so primary navigation is collapsed by default and opened from an accessible menu button.
- Preserved the desktop horizontal navigation at `md+`.

### Changed surfaces

- Global site header
- Mobile navigation panel

### Verification evidence

- Focused TDD run failed before implementation because `src/lib/site-navigation.ts` did not exist.
- Focused TDD run passed after implementation.
- `npm run lint` exited `0`.
- `npm test` passed 19 files / 76 tests.
- `npm run build` exited `0` and generated 735 static pages.
- Browser verification covered 375px mobile collapsed/open header, captured screenshot, confirmed no horizontal overflow, and console errors `0`.
